It is the first COVID-19 vaccine maker to apply for U.S. regulatory authorization for the age group.

The company recently reported that a low dose of the vaccine is safe and effective in children ages 5-11. The vaccine currently has emergency use authorization in children ages 12-15 and full FDA approval for use in people ages 16 and older.

The development likely comes as a sigh of relief for the 34% of parents who said in a recent poll that they will vaccinate their 5-11-year-olds "right away" once a vaccine is authorized for their age group. But the U.S. could continue running up against the issue of vaccine hesitancy, as nearly one in five of the parents surveyed said they definitely won't get their kid the shot.

As the delta coronavirus variant spread and kids returned to school, the number of new child coronavirus cases spiked and remains exceptionally high, according to a report from The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association. Children are making up nearly 27% of new cases, according to the report.

U.S. health officials have pledged to act fast on Pfizer's application. The FDA vaccine advisory committee is set to meet and discuss the proposal on Oct. 26.
